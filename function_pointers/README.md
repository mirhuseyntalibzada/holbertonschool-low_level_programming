# 0x0F. Function Pointers

## ðŸ“Œ Project: Simple Calculator

This project demonstrates the use of **function pointers** in C by building a basic calculator that can perform five arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

### ðŸ’¡ Goal

> "A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at."  
> â€” Bruce Lee

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with:
- Function pointers
- Structs containing function pointers
- Dynamic function selection at runtime
- Argument validation and error handling
